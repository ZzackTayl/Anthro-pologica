# Agent Rules

## Branch Protection

**IMPORTANT**: The current working branch is `Ginnett`. 

Do NOT switch away from this branch without first:
1. Double-checking with Zack
2. Getting explicit confirmation from the user

This rule applies to all git checkout, git switch, or any other branch-changing operations.
