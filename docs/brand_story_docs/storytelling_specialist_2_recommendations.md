# MyOrbit Case Study: Visual Storytelling & Research Integration Recommendations

**Prepared by:** Storytelling Specialist (Brand Document Review)
**Date:** November 25, 2025
**Purpose:** Design a compelling, research-backed MyOrbit Case Study page that converts visitors through credible citations and strategic visual storytelling

---

## Executive Summary

After analyzing the citation guide, ready-to-use citations, and content angles documentation, I recommend a **narrative-driven case study structure** that positions MyOrbit as a research-validated solution to real market problems. The page should tell a story arc from "problem discovery" through "research-backed solution" to "measurable impact," using data visualizations and authoritative citations at strategic moments to build credibility and drive action.

**Key Principles:**
- Lead with compelling narrative, support with data
- Use citations to build authority without overwhelming readers
- Deploy visuals to make complex research scannable and memorable
- Maintain conversational tone while demonstrating expertise
- No em dashes in written content (per brand guidelines)

## Page Structure & Visual Storytelling Map

### SECTION 1: Hero / Opening Hook
**Position:** Top of page (above the fold)
**Narrative Purpose:** Grab attention with a relatable problem statement backed by shocking statistics
**Content Strategy:** Open with the crisis, not the solution

#### Recommended Content:
**Headline:** "95% of Products Fail. MyOrbit Wasn't Going to Be One of Them."

**Subheadline:** "Here's how rigorous UX research, privacy-first design, and community co-creation turned a calendar app into a lifeline for 70 million neurodivergent Americans."

**Visual Element #1: Animated Statistic Counter**
- **Type:** Animated number display with source attribution
- **Content:** "95%" prominently displayed, counting up from 0 to 95
- **Supporting text:** "of new products fail without user validation"
- **Citation:** Small text below: "Clayton Christensen, Harvard Business School"
- **Why here:** Immediately establishes credibility and creates urgency. The animation creates visual interest and makes the statistic memorable. This positions the entire case study around the central question: "How do you beat 95% odds?"
- **Technical specs:** 2-3 second animation, large typography (72pt+), brand color accent on percentage

**Visual Element #2: Problem Statement Graphic**
- **Type:** Icon-based problem grid or illustrated pain points
- **Content:** Visual representation of 3-4 core user problems
  - Calendar apps invade privacy (lock icon)
  - Existing tools ignore neurodivergent needs (brain/puzzle icon)
  - Sharing is all-or-nothing (broken sharing icon)
  - Social features feel forced or unsafe (disconnected people icon)
- **Why here:** Makes abstract problems concrete and scannable. Users self-identify with pain points before reading further.
- **Technical specs:** Simple iconography, minimal color, horizontal or 2x2 grid layout

---

### SECTION 2: The Research Foundation
**Position:** Early in the narrative, after hook
**Narrative Purpose:** Establish Anthropologica's research-driven credibility
**Content Strategy:** Show the methodology that prevented MyOrbit from becoming another failed product

#### Recommended Content:
**Section Header:** "We Started With Questions, Not Solutions"

**Body Copy:**
"Most products fail because founders skip the hardest part: actually listening to users. P&G's Febreze nearly became a billion-dollar failure until they did in-home user testing and discovered consumers couldn't smell their own odors. We learned from that lesson."

**Visual Element #3: Research Process Timeline**
- **Type:** Horizontal timeline infographic with milestone markers
- **Content:**
  - May 2024: Initial problem discovery interviews (20+ neurodivergent users)
  - June 2024: Competitive analysis (7 calendar apps, 200+ user reviews)
  - July-August: Bi-weekly design jams with target users
  - September: Privacy architecture validation
  - October: Soft launch with core community
  - November: Iterative feedback loops
- **Why here:** Demonstrates systematic approach vs. "we had an idea and built it." Shows time investment and user-centric process. Creates trust that MyOrbit is validated, not speculative.

  - Citation: "Charles Duhigg, The Power of Habit / WSS International, 2022"
- **Why here:** Establishes precedent that user research saves products. Creates narrative parallel to MyOrbit's approach. Third-party validation from authoritative source.

---

## Citation Integration Strategy

### Principle: Citations Should Support, Not Interrupt
- **Primary citations:** Inline with stats, formatted as "(Source Name, Year)"
- **Secondary citations:** Hover tooltips or footnote numbers with expandable details
- **Full source list:** "Research Sources" accordion at page bottom for deep readers

### Recommended Citation Formats by Location:

**In Headlines/Large Stats:**
- Large number, small source below
- Example: "95%" (large) / "Harvard Business School" (small)

**In Body Copy:**
- Inline parenthetical
- Example: "According to recent research (Deloitte 2025), privacy concerns jumped..."

**In Visual Elements:**
- Caption below chart/graph
- Example: "Source: Stratistics Market Research, 2025"

**For Multiple Sources:**
- Footnote style with hover/click for full list
- Example: "Research shows AI productivity gains of 21-26%*" (*Google, GitHub, DORA studies)

### Citation Hierarchy (Use These First):
1. **Harvard/MIT/Academic:** Maximum credibility, use for foundational claims
2. **Major Consulting (Deloitte, Cisco):** Strong credibility for market trends
3. **Specialized Research (Stratistics, Label Insight):** Strong for specific claims
4. **Industry Sources (ArXiv, CB Insights):** Good for technical/startup claims

---

## Visual Design Principles

### Typography Hierarchy:
- **Headlines:** Bold, 48-60pt, brand primary color
- **Stats:** Extra bold, 72-96pt, accent color
- **Body copy:** Regular, 16-18pt, high contrast for readability
- **Citations:** Light, 12-14pt, muted color

### Color Strategy:
- **Primary brand color:** Key CTAs and major stats
- **Accent color:** Highlights and data visualization
- **Neutral palette:** Body text, backgrounds, secondary info
- **Success green / Alert red:** Use sparingly in comparison visuals

### Accessibility Requirements:
- All text meets WCAG AA contrast ratios (minimum)
- All interactive elements keyboard navigable
- All data visualizations have text alternatives
- All animations respect `prefers-reduced-motion`
- All videos have captions

### Mobile-First Considerations:
- Charts convert to vertical/stacked on mobile
- Tables become cards or accordions
- Carousels are swipeable with indicators
- All CTAs are thumb-friendly (minimum 44x44px)

---

## Content Tone Guidelines

### Voice Characteristics:
- **Confident but not arrogant:** "We learned from P&G's Febreze" not "We're smarter than everyone"
- **Data-driven but human:** Lead with stories, support with stats
- **Transparent about limits:** "Here's what we're still figuring out"
- **Inclusive without being preachy:** Show diversity, don't lecture about it

### Language Rules:
- **No em dashes:** Use periods, commas, or parentheses instead
- **Active voice:** "We conducted 47 interviews" not "47 interviews were conducted"
- **Specific over vague:** "21% faster" not "significantly faster"
- **Plain language:** "Calendar sharing" not "temporal coordination optimization"

### Storytelling Flow:
1. **Open with tension:** The 95% failure rate
2. **Introduce the hero's journey:** How Anthropologica approached differently
3. **Show the evidence:** Research process and findings
4. **Reveal the solution:** MyOrbit features tied to insights
5. **Demonstrate impact:** Early results and user stories
6. **Invite participation:** CTAs that welcome users into the story

- **CTA clicks:** Which conversion paths work best
- **Citation clicks:** Which sources users want to verify

### A/B Testing Opportunities:
- Hero statistic (95% vs. 70M neurodivergent vs. 70% privacy concern)
- Section order (research-first vs. problem-first)
- CTA language ("Join Beta" vs. "Try MyOrbit" vs. "Join Movement")
- Visual density (data-heavy vs. story-heavy)
