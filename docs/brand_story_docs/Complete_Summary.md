# Comprehensive Summary: Everything You've Shared About Anthropologica & MyOrbit

---

## PART 1: FOUNDING & MISSION

### **Origin Story (May 2025)**
- Two of your three co-founders were looking for work and couldn't find opportunities aligned with their values
- You were working part-time at Applause (UX Researcher), serving clients like Amazon, Uber, McDonald's, Roche Healthcare, AIVF, and others
- You were experimenting with AI tools in your off-hours and noticing critical gaps in how companies use AI
- Instead of traditional job hunting, the three of you decided to bootstrap a venture studio
- All three co-founders are neurodivergent; two are LGBTQ+; one is Gen X; more than two are polyamorous

### **Anthropologica: The Venture Studio**
**Mission:** Build products, apps, or services that solve real user problems at fair prices, with more personalization and accessibility options, and overall authenticity

**Core Values:**
- Listen to users and involve them in the design/experience process
- Be fair, transparent, and sustainable with pricing
- Support causes customers care about: LGBTQ+, neurodivergence, accessibility
- Bootstrap intentionally (open to aligned funding, but not chasing it)
- Never IPO (believe going public shifts focus from customers to shareholders)
- Only work with/hire people who share core values and mission
- Only sell to companies/entities that promise to uphold core principles
- Pay living wages
- Harness neurodivergence as a competitive advantage, not a bug
- Never harvest data unless paying users fairly (and only if mission-aligned)

### **5 Years of UX Research Context**
- You've delivered research findings to 30+ companies (startups to Fortune 50)
- Consistent pattern: Companies that listen to users build products that matter. Companies that don't... fail.
- You've watched companies:
  - Ignore user research in favor of assumptions
  - Make decisions based on synthetic users (ChatGPT) instead of real people
  - Use AI to moderate user interviews (which doesn't work—AI can't understand context or follow up meaningfully)
  - Cut UX budgets while declaring "UX is dead now that AI exists"
  - Prioritize growth/hype/quick sales over user needs
  - Throw features at products that users never asked for
  - Harvest as much data as possible

---

## PART 2: THE AHA MOMENT

### **The UX Crisis Nobody's Talking About**
Leadership thinks **UX is dead** because they've confused UX with UI. They think AI can replace design/research. The reality:
- AI cannot understand contextualized information
- AI cannot know when to ask follow-up questions
- AI cannot read silence/discomfort
- AI cannot understand that people behave differently with machines vs. humans
- Companies using AI-moderated user interviews get expensive confirmation bias, not real research

### **Your Key Insight**
In a world where anyone can build an app quickly (thanks to AI), **only products that connect deeply with real users will survive**. That means:
- The methodology matters more than ever
- UX research is more critical, not less
- You need rigorous human-centered design thinking
- You need to pay attention to *why* people use (or don't use) products, not just build features

**The secret recipe:** UX research (what/why) + Neurodivergent thinking (permission to diverge/explore) + Intentional AI use (strategic, not hype) = Products that feel magical because they solve real problems in unexpected ways

---

## PART 3: THE THREE CORE STRENGTHS OF ANTHROPOLOGICA

### **1. Grounding Work in UX/Product Strategy via Direct Customer Participation**
- Not building on assumptions; building on research
- User interviews, social listening, online ethnography, competitor analysis
- Assumption mapping to challenge thinking
- Constant user feedback loops (not just at launch, but ongoing)
- Community co-design (biweekly design jams on Discord where users shape the product)

### **2. Strategic AI Use: When, Where, and How**
- Use AI for: synthesis of research, ideation/variations on designs, support (copywriting, organizing), accessibility features (NLI, optional messaging assistance)
- Don't use AI for: research decisions, user testing, replacing human judgment
- A/B test everything with real humans
- Be intentional and research how users *feel* about AI
- User research findings: Users okay with AI-generated animations/icons (see as "computer-generated"). Users hate AI video with fake humans (kills trust). Users appreciate AI-assisted scheduling only if it asks permission and shows options

### **3. Diverge & Converge: Structured + Unstructured Time**
**Diverge phase:** Explore, investigate, go down rabbit holes, experiment freely, hyperfocus on problems
- One co-founder hyperfocuses on user flows and catches edge cases others miss
- Another pattern-matches across research data and spots connections
- A third brings relentless detail work that catches inconsistencies
- Spend time on seemingly tangential exploration that often unlocks breakthroughs

**Converge phase:** Prioritize, synthesize, challenge assumptions, focus on key differentiators
- Use a prioritization matrix: Does it solve a research-backed pain point? Can we validate it? Does it differentiate? Development effort?
- Weekly synthesis meetings where you consolidate findings and decide what matters most
- Say no to things (even good ideas) that don't fit current priorities

**Structure:** Mix of async work + core sync times + documented decisions. Weekends for unstructured exploration. Weekly check-ins that include "how are we feeling" not just "what got done"

---

## PART 4: MYORBIT - THE FIRST PRODUCT

### **Timeline**
- May 2025: Idea + research begins
- June-October 2025: 5 months of research, prototyping, iteration, user testing
- October 2025: Frontend development completed
- November 2025: Working with developer for security/safety (soft launch in 10 days—Nov 30ish)
- 6 months total from idea to soft launch

### **The Problem MyOrbit Solves**

**Pain Point 1: Time Blindness & Notification Failure**
- Neurodivergent users constantly miss calendar notifications (they pop up, disappear, get buried)
- Time passes invisibly; suddenly it's too late
- Existing apps: push harder with more notifications (causes fatigue)
- Our solution: Reliable, attention-grabbing notifications; customizable urgency; circular 24h view for visual time perception

**Pain Point 2: Privacy Nightmare (Relationship Complexity)**
- Gen Z, queer, neurodivergent users need different visibility levels for different people
- Live with unsupportive parents; also have supportive stepmom; have partners; have chosen family; have work colleagues
- Example: "I need my dad to know I'm busy Friday but NOT see I'm on a date with my boyfriend. I need my boyfriend to see 'date night.' I need my best friend to see 'date night with the girls' because she's crashing with me."
- Existing apps: Binary sharing (share calendar or don't); confusing controls
- Our solution: Granular, event-level permission controls. Show "Busy" to dad, full details to boyfriend, event title + time to friend, nothing to colleague

**Pain Point 3: Loneliness in Scheduling Friction**
- Coordinating across multiple apps (text, calendar, polls) kills motivation to hang out
- Polyamorous users: limited time with multiple partners, coordination takes away precious time together
- Existing apps: Don't address the friction; make scheduling harder
- Our solution: Native language input, signals feature (covert broadcast: "Making coffee, come vibe?"), collaborative scheduling, AI assistance (reschedule conflicts, generate brief messages in your voice—only if enabled)

**Pain Point 4: Friendship Drift**
- People feel guilty about not reaching out (time just passes)
- Neurodivergent + polyamorous users: especially vulnerable to accidentally neglecting someone
- Existing apps: No feature to address this
- Our solution: Orbit feature—each person is a planet in your night sky. As you schedule time, planet stays close/bright. As time passes, planet drifts away. Optional, covert visual nudges/reminders

### **Research Backing**
- Scraped reviews from Timetree, Howbout, Google Calendar, Proton Calendar, Weel Planner
- Conducted screened user interviews with core personas: neurodivergent Gen Z, LGBTQ+ users, polyamorous folks
- Surveys, pain point tagging, online ethnography, Reddit listening, competitor deep-dive
- Over a dozen NotebookLM folders for different aspects: marketing/social, Flutter development, color theory, user insights, etc.
- A/B tested ad approaches on Reddit; tested notifications (47 different approaches); tested permission UI variations; tested orbit visual concept

### **Three Biggest Market Gaps MyOrbit Fills**
1. **No calendar respects relationship hierarchy/sharing privacy** → Each relationship is nuanced and requires different visibility. Our granular permissions solve this.
2. **Most calendars assume traditional life structures** → 9-5 work, traditional family, monogamous partnerships. They ignore time blindness, complex relationships, neurodivergence.
3. **No product addresses time blindness + social anxiety around scheduling** → Combined with a way to maintain friendships without the friction of coordination.

### **Core Features Launching**
- Multiple calendar views (linear, circular ADHD-friendly, day/week/month)
- Granular event-level permission controls
- Orbit feature (visual connection tracking + optional nudges)
- Signals (covert availability broadcast)
- Customizable notifications (intensity, timing, delivery method)
- Natural language input for events
- Optional AI assistance for rescheduling (with human approval)
- No data harvesting; analytics only

### **What's NOT shipping yet**
- Complex calendar integrations (validating UX first)
- Group management at scale (starting with intimate circles)
- Advanced AI features (only after user testing)

### **Success Metrics (Not Traditional)**
- User retention + organic growth (not DAU/viral coefficient)
- Do users feel like you built something that respects them?
- Do they recommend it to friends?
- Community engagement in design jams

### **Target Audience**
- Neurodivergent users (especially ADHD, autistic)
- Gen Z
- LGBTQ+ users
- Polyamorous/ENM users
- Privacy-conscious people
- People struggling with friendship maintenance + time blindness

**Strategic note:** Polyamorous users were entry point (tight-knit community, value sharing, natural referral), but messaging frames it broadly to reach Gen Z, LGBTQ+, neurodivergent audiences (which overlap significantly)

### **Competitive Positioning**

| Competitor | What They Do Well | Critical Gap | How We Differ |
|---|---|---|---|
| Google Calendar | Ecosystem integration, ubiquitous, free | Confusing privacy; cognitively heavy; work-focused | Privacy-first; neurodivergent-friendly; relationship-first |
| Howbout | Gen Z casual coordination | Overwhelming notifications; mobile-only; poor sharing | Customizable notifications; works across devices; relationship nuance |
| Proton Calendar | Privacy-focused, encrypted | Limited features; no social coordination; no ND support | Privacy + social features + accessibility |
| Weel Planner | ADHD-friendly visuals; queer-owned | Passive tool; weak AI; limited data architecture | Active AI; sophisticated data; community co-design |
| Reclaim.ai / Clockwise | AI automation; focus time | Expensive; work-only; ignores relationships | Affordable; relationship-focused; personal + professional |

## PART 5: SPOON SAVER (PARALLEL PROJECT)

### **Status**
- Mostly completed by you alone: research, prototyping, front-end development
- Approved by team but not prioritized (using prioritization matrix)
- Scope was shrunk for MVP
- Will launch after MyOrbit is established (unless another project votes ahead via matrix)

### **What It Is**
- App to help neurodivergent users navigate mental energy (spoons—ADHD metaphor for executive function)
- Share that data with coaches, therapists, doctors
- Inspired others to work with you (saw the work and wanted in)

### **Why You're Sharing This in Content**
- Example of how you (neurodivergent) can pivot and focus on what matters most at the given time
- Shows you don't get hung up on the wrong thing or go down wrong rabbit holes
- Demonstrates ability to "kill your baby when needed" (film school lesson)

---

## PART 6: CHALLENGES & WHAT YOU NEED HELP WITH

### **Current Challenges**
- All three working for free; runway is finite
- Marketing is hard when you refuse to be manipulative (no dark patterns, fake urgency, misleading CTAs)
- Competing against companies that use exploitative tactics
- Privacy/security slows development but is non-negotiable
- Not venture-scale (which is intentional, but comes with constraints)
- Some team dynamics take work (async communication slower; analysis paralysis possible; hyperfocus tangents need structure)
- Some hyperfocus work that seemed tangential later unlocked important discoveries (but sometimes didn't)

### **What You Need Right Now**
1. **Marketing strategy & community partnerships** → Organic growth, authentic partnerships, community building
2. **Flutter development** → Experienced developers to scale backend safely
3. **Content creation** → Marketing/social content for neurodivergent/LGBTQ+/Gen Z audiences
4. **General support from people with:**
   - Go-to-market experience
   - Startup launch expertise
   - High bias for action
   - Mission alignment
   - Non-traditional backgrounds welcome

### **Team Composition**
- Two co-founders: show up similarly (likely both ADHD or similar profiles); hyperffocus on user flows; catch edge cases
- One co-founder: very different, quiet, brings highly detailed work naturally; catches inconsistencies; vital early feedback provider
- You: pivot from research to design; storytelling skills; research methodology + design strategy; bridge between team insight and external narrative

### **How You Work Together**
- Understand each other without constant explanation (shared neurodivergence)
- Share values
- Different from neurotypical teams (structure + flexibility, async-friendly, doc-heavy)
- Weekly check-ins include emotional health check, not just productivity

---

## PART 7: CONTENT STRATEGY & VALUES

### **Marketing Philosophy**
- Organic, authentic engagement (no hard CTAs; conversational/educational approach)
- Community partnerships with established creators in target spaces (ENM, poly, LGBTQ+, neurodivergent creators on Instagram/TikTok)
- Partner on unique content in exchange for partnership
- Users reject CTAs; prefer authenticity
- Design jams as main community engagement
- Content segmented by demographic with some overlap

### **Content Tracking**
- Measure: likes, shares, comments, overall impact
- Informs what's connecting with audiences

### **Brand Approach**
- Playful (cartoons fan; exploring playful brand ideas aligned with core users)
- Authentic neurodivergent selves (humble acknowledgment of faults/challenges)
- Story-driven (users' stories ground the work)
- Professional but true to authentic neurodivergent identity

### **Design Principles Created**
- Based on research, tested in real-time via social media, A/B tests, surveys, usability tests, user interviews
- Covers: color, design (design for neurodivergence + customizability), iconography, more
- All stored in NotebookLM folders for reference

---

## PART 8: TEAM STRENGTHS & PHILOSOPHY

### **Why Neurodivergence is a Competitive Advantage**
- Permission to diverge: explore strange solutions, hyperfocus on problems, spend hours on creative rabbit holes
- Then converge: quickly synthesize, prioritize, challenge assumptions
- Empathy for users: feel struggles more deeply because you live them
- Different perspectives (two similar profiles + one very different = comprehensive view)
- Innovation: approach problems differently than neurotypical teams

### **How Neurodivergence Shows Up**
- Some of you go on and on when hyperfocused; get ahead of problems solving scenarios that haven't come up yet
- Initially confusing; required team conversation
- Realized hyperfocus tangents often surfaced issues early, found new approaches, created roadmap of ideas to explore
- Instead of pathologizing, you structured work *around* it

### **Why You Built a Venture Studio**
- Watched companies fail by ignoring users
- Knew you had the secret recipe: UX methodology + permission to diverge + strategic AI
- Wanted to build companies you'd want to use and work at
- Neurodivergent and queer—weren't fitting into traditional work paths
- Decided to build own path instead

### **Values in Action**
- Fair pricing (not multiple upgrade tiers; not extractive)
- Transparency (about what you know, what you don't)
- Authenticity (real about challenges, failures, what you need)
- Community-first (users shape the product)
- Cause-driven (support LGBTQ+, neurodivergence)
- Never going public (never sacrificing users for shareholders)

---

## PART 9: AI STRATEGY & PHILOSOPHY

### **How You Use AI Intentionally**
- **For:** Synthesis of research, ideation/variations, support tasks (copywriting, organizing), accessibility features
- **Not for:** Research decisions, user testing, replacing judgment
- Everything A/B tested with humans
- Research shows: Users okay with AI animations/icons; hate AI video with fake humans; appreciate AI scheduling assistance if it asks permission

### **The Larger Context**
- Most companies pushing AI into places it shouldn't be
- When used appropriately, AI feels magical
- When used inappropriately, it kills trust immediately
- Your advantage: You test and iterate; most competitors don't

---

## PART 10: KEY STATISTICS & PROOF POINTS

### **Research Data You Have**
- Number of reviews scraped from competitors
- Stats on users and pain points they face (time blindness prevalence, etc.)
- Stats from your surveys (not statistically significant but highly screened, so statistical significance less critical)
- User quotes and stories from interviews
- A/B test results from Reddit ads (users' AI preferences)
- Testing results from notification design (47 approaches tested)
- Competitor feature/UX comparison

---

## PART 11: LAUNCH TIMING & BETA STRATEGY

### **Soft Launch: November 30, 2025** (10 days from now)
- Beta period with daily iteration based on community feedback
- Biweekly design jams where users influence roadmap
- Rigorous privacy/security testing
- A/B testing on messaging, notifications, AI
- Ongoing user research for post-beta releases

### **Not Launching Yet**
- Complex integrations
- Advanced features without user testing
- Things that compromise privacy/security

---

## PART 12: YOUR BACKGROUND & CREDIBILITY

### **UX Research Experience**
- 5+ years as UXR
- Worked with startups to Fortune 50 companies
- Worked at agencies serving major clients: Amazon, Uber, McDonald's, Roche Healthcare, AIVF
- Delivered research findings to 30+ companies
- Watched patterns: companies that listen to users build products that matter

### **Film School Background**
- Learned importance of: killing your baby when needed, pivoting, collaboration
- Same principles apply to product development

### **Transition**
- Pivoted from research to design during MyOrbit development
- Realized you were "secretly a closeted designer"
- Now uniquely positioned to combine research rigor with design thinking + AI literacy

---

## PART 13: DIFFERENTIATORS (Why Anthropologica Matters)

1. **Research-backed, not assumption-based** → Every decision traced back to user data
2. **Neurodivergent team structure** → Diverge/converge methodology amplifies innovation
3. **Intentional AI use** → Strategic, tested, not hype
4. **Community co-design** → Users shape the product
5. **Values-first** → Won't compromise on ethics for growth
6. **Transparent about limitations** → "Here's what we're good at and not good at"
7. **Long-term thinking** → Never IPO; always user-first

---

## PART 14: THE BIGGER PICTURE

### **Why This Matters to the World**
- Companies have been taking from users, not giving value
- Most apps harvest data, throw unwanted features, prioritize hype over user needs
- Users feel it—they know when they're being exploited
- Neurodivergent and queer communities especially vulnerable to predatory design
- There's a better way: build with people, respect privacy, support causes they care about, design for accessibility from day one

### **The Future Anthropologica is Building**
- Proof point that you don't need VC to build meaningful products
- Model for how neurodivergent teams can lead innovation
- Companies that win: user-centered, relationship-first, research-backed, intentionally using new tools
- Not about disruption for its own sake; about solving real problems people actually have

---
