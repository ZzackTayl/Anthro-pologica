## DETAILED SCRIPT

### **HOOK + MISSION (0:00-0:15)**

**Visual:** Founders on screen or quick clips of the app in action (calendar interface, the orbit feature, notifications)

**Voiceover (Warm, Direct, Slightly Personal):**

> "We're three neurodivergent UX designers. In May, two of us couldn't find work that felt aligned with our values. So we started building something we desperately needed: a calendar app that actually gets us. One that doesn't treat us like we're broken. One that was built *with* people like us, not *for* us from a distance."

**Why This Works:** 
- Opens with identity + stakes (relatable for ND/LGBTQ+/Gen Z audiences)
- Establishes authenticity (not a corporate pitch)
- Signals this isn't another feature-bloated app

---

### **THE PROBLEM (0:15-0:45)**

**Visual:** Screen recording of Google Calendar, Howbout, or other competitors showing clunky interfaces; overlay with user research quotes/pain points on screen

**Voiceover:**

> "Here's what we noticed: most calendar apps assume everyone's life looks the same. Work 9-to-5. Maybe a family dinner on Sunday. But that's not real life anymore—especially for Gen Z, queer folks, and people like us who are neurodivergent.
>
> We researched hundreds of conversations. Reddit threads. Reviews. Real problems:
> - Time blindness making you miss notifications you never saw disappear
> - Sharing your calendar and suddenly your homophobic parent sees your date night
> - Juggling multiple calendars and apps just to coordinate time with people you care about
> - Loneliness. Because scheduling became so friction-heavy, people stopped trying."

**User Research Callouts (Text on Screen):**
- "I miss calendar notifications"
- "I need the ability to share only 'busy' with some people, full details with others"
- "Scheduling friends has become more exhausting than the time together is worth"

**Why This Works:**
- Grounded in *actual* research (not assumptions)
- Speaks to multiple personas without alienating any
- Shows you understand the lived experience

---

### **OUR APPROACH (0:45-1:30)**

**Visual:** Show app screens — the circular ADHD-friendly view, the "planets" feature, permission settings, the signals feature

**Voiceover:**

> "We spent six months doing the things most startups skip: talking to actual users. Mapping their journeys. Testing our assumptions. Iterating. Not guessing.
>
> We designed everything around reducing cognitive load. A circular calendar view that works for time-blind brains. Notifications that actually hold your attention. And here's what nobody else did: *granular permission controls.*
>
> You can share 'Busy: date night with the girls' with your best friend who's crashing with you. Show your dad you're busy Friday, but *not* what you're doing. Your boyfriend sees the full details. Same calendar. Different privacy for different people. Because your life isn't one-size-fits-all, and neither is our product."

**Visual Sequence:**
1. Circular calendar interface (0:45-0:55)
2. Permission/sharing UI (0:55-1:10)
3. Notifications feature (1:10-1:15)
4. Planets/connection tracking (1:15-1:30)

**Why This Works:**
- Shows *what* you built and *why* it matters
- Demonstrates UX thinking (not just feature lists)
- Privacy angle speaks to a real, underserved fear

### **WHAT MAKES US DIFFERENT (1:30-2:00)**

**Visual:** Quick montage of your team, Discord community, design jam footage if you have it, or just B-roll of collaborative work

**Voiceover:**

> "But here's the thing: we're not some company trying to harvest your data or chase a billion-dollar exit. We're neurodivergent designers who've spent our careers watching companies ignore their users, then wonder why the product failed.
>
> We built this *with* our community. Biweekly design jams on Discord. Real feedback. Real iteration. Our users aren't just beta testers—they're partners. And that changes everything.
>
> We're also intentional about AI. We used it to amplify our research, to help us iterate faster, to make the product more accessible. But we tested everything with real humans. Because AI without human validation is just expensive guesswork."

**Why This Works:**
- Differentiates you from typical startups (community-first)
- Shows AI as a tool, not a replacement for UX
- Appeals to values-driven people (your future collaborators)

---

### **CALL TO COMMUNITY (2:00-2:15)**

**Visual:** Discord invite link on screen, maybe a quick clip of your community channel, or just a warm closing shot of your team

**Voiceover:**

> "We're launching in 10 days. And we need help. Marketing partners who get what we're building. Developers passionate about accessibility. Community builders who want to help us grow this the right way.
>
> If you want to be part of something that actually values you, where your neurodivergence isn't a problem to solve—it's a superpower—join our Discord. Build with us. Let's make scheduling less lonely."

**CTA on Screen:** 
- Discord link (large, clear)
- "Join our community" text

**Why This Works:**
- Specific ask (not generic "sign up" CTA that feels corporate)
- Positions joining as collaborative, not transactional
- Ends on values alignment, not a hard sell

## PRODUCTION NOTES

### **Tone & Delivery:**
- **Not corporate.** You're storytelling, not pitching.
- **Honest.** Mention the challenges ("we need help").
- **Playful.** You're allowed to smile, be warm, let your personality show.

### **Visual Elements to Capture:**
1. **App screenshots/screen recordings** (at least 3-4 different screens showing key features)
2. **Team footage** (doesn't need to be fancy—genuine is better than polished)
3. **Discord community glimpses** (blurred if needed for privacy)
4. **User quotes as text overlays** (makes research visible)
5. **Competitor screenshots** (for context, neutral framing)

### **Audio:**
- Background music (subtle, upbeat but not distracting—think indie/lo-fi)
- Natural voiceover (yours, ideally—your authentic voice matters here)
- Optional: brief team member soundbites ("Why I joined," "What this means to me")

### **Platform Optimization:**
- **LinkedIn:** Post full version, tease with 30-sec clip
- **TikTok/Reels:** Cut into 3-4 separate 30-60 sec segments with text hooks
- **Discord:** Embed full video + context about what you're looking for
- **Website:** Homepage hero or dedicated story section
- **YouTube:** Full upload with timestamps in description

## TALKING POINTS (If You Do a Live Q&A or Podcast)

**Q: Why now?**
A: "We realized in May that the gap between what companies *say* they're doing for neurodivergent and queer users and what they *actually* do was massive. And we had the skills to build something better."

**Q: What's the biggest thing you discovered in your research?**
A: "That people don't want fewer features. They want *fewer decisions*. Every extra click or cognitive load point made people drop off. So we designed for simplicity with power underneath."

**Q: How do you use AI without it feeling gimmicky?**
A: "We tested everything with users first. We only use AI where it genuinely saves time or makes the product more accessible. If it doesn't pass the 'would this feel magical to my user' test, we cut it."

**Q: Who should join your team right now?**
A: "People who care more about impact than exit valuations. Developers who understand accessibility isn't a nice-to-have. Marketers who want to reach people authentically. People who are tired of the startup hype cycle."

## ALTERNATIVE OPENING (If You Want to Start With Personal Problem)

**Hook Option B:**
> "I'm ADHD. My business partner is autistic. Our third is ADHD + dyslexic. Together, we're neurodivergent designers with 5+ years of UX research across startups, agencies, and Fortune 50 companies. And we kept seeing the same problem: when companies actually *listened* to their users, they built better products. When they didn't, they failed. So we built MyOrbit—a calendar app designed by and for people like us."

**Use this if:**
- You want to lean heavily on ND identity
- Your audience is mostly UX/product professionals
- You want to establish credibility early

---

## ALTERNATIVE CLOSE (If You Want Broader CTA)

**Close Option B:**
> "We're soft-launching in 10 days. Join our community on Discord to shape the product with us, share feedback, and be part of a team that's actually trying to do something different. Link in the bio."

**Use this if:**
- You want to keep it simpler
- You're prioritizing growth over specificity
- You want to avoid asking for specific skill sets
