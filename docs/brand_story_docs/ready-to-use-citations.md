## How to Integrate These Into Your Website

### Option 1: Values Page With Citations
Create a dedicated "Our Values" or "Our Approach" page with short, punchy statements backed by citations:

```
UX Testing First
"95% of new products fail because they skip user validation. We've learned from companies like P&G's Febreze (nearly a billion-dollar failure until they did in-home testing) that rigorous user research isn't optional—it's survival."
— Clayton Christensen, Harvard Business School; P&G case study
```

### Option 2: Footer / Trust Section
Create a small trust/transparency section at the bottom of key pages:

```
BY THE NUMBERS
• 95% of products fail without user testing
• 94% of consumers prefer transparent brands
• 47% abandon companies over data practices
• 70M+ neurodivergent people deserve better products

We're building differently.
```

### Option 3: About Section
Weave citations into your team narrative:

```
We started because we were tired of seeing products fail. The statistics are brutal: 95% of new products never find market fit. But we knew why. P&G's Febreze almost failed too—until they listened to actual users in their homes. That taught us everything we needed to know about building right.

Data doesn't lie. 94% of consumers want transparency. 47% leave companies over privacy practices. 70 million neurodivergent people use products designed by people who forgot about them. We're fixing that.
```

## Citation Best Practices

1. **Use full researcher/organization names**: "According to Harvard Business School Professor Clayton Christensen" is stronger than just "Research shows..."

2. **Include dates when recent**: "Deloitte's 2025 study" signals this is current data

3. **Link to source when possible**: If you have access to publish blog posts, link directly to primary sources (increases credibility and SEO)

4. **Be specific about the finding**: "95% fail" is better than "most fail"—specificity builds trust

5. **Combine multiple sources for credibility**: "Clayton Christensen's research, validated by MIT and UserTesting..."

6. **Use quotes strategically**: Don't overuse—one or two powerful quotes per page is better than citation overload

## Recommended Font/Visual Treatment

Consider:
- **Bold numbers**: Make statistics visual (use color, size, or callout boxes)
- **Light sourcing**: Keep citations subtle so they support claims without becoming visual clutter
- **Trust indicators**: Logos of universities/organizations cited (Harvard, MIT, Deloitte, Cisco, etc.) if possible
