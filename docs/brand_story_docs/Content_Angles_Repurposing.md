# Anthropologica Content Angles: 8 Ways to Share Your Story Across Platforms & Formats

**Goal:** Repurpose your core narrative across different audiences, formats, and platforms without overselling or burning out your team.

---

## ANGLE 1: "The UX Crisis Nobody's Talking About" (LinkedIn Thought Leadership)

**Format:** LinkedIn article or carousel posts (2-3 posts)

**Audience:** UX/product professionals, tech leaders, CTOs, design directors

**Core Message:** Leadership is declaring UX dead because they don't understand what UX actually *is*. AI didn't kill UX—it made UX more critical.

**Content Hooks:**
- "I've delivered research findings to stakeholders at 30+ companies. Here's the pattern: teams that listened to users built products that mattered. Teams that didn't... well, they burned money."
- "The biggest mistake companies make: using AI to moderate user interviews. [Here's why that doesn't work.] A real example from a company I consulted with..."
- "Your leaders think UX is dead. Here's what they actually mean: they think UI is dead. And they're wrong about that too."

**Posts to Create:**
1. **Post 1 (Carousel):** "5 Signs Your Company Doesn't Actually Understand UX" (each slide = one sign)
2. **Post 2 (Article):** "Why AI-Moderated User Research Is Expensive Guesswork" (deep dive)
3. **Post 3 (Thought):** "The companies winning right now? They're doing something competitors skipped: asking actual users what they need." (with MyOrbit as subtle example)

**Supporting Assets:** Competitor comparison table, research methodology breakdown, before/after examples of user research impact

**Distribution:** LinkedIn posts/articles, potentially republished on Medium or Substack

## TONE & VOICE ACROSS ANGLES

**LinkedIn:** Professional but warm. Data-backed. Thought leadership.
**TikTok/Reels:** Fun, relatable, sometimes playful. Short punchy takes. Visual.
**Blog/Medium:** Narrative-driven, detailed, vulnerable. "Here's our story."
**Discord:** Casual, real-time, conversational. Behind-the-scenes feeling.
**Podcasts:** Authentic, willing to go deep. Storytelling with specifics.

---

## KEY REMINDERS

- **You don't have to post everywhere constantly.** Pick 2-3 channels and do them well.
- **Repurpose ruthlessly.** One good story = 5+ pieces of content across formats/platforms.
- **Let your community help.** Ask users for testimonials, quotes, stories. They'll create content for you.
- **Authenticity > Polish.** A slightly rough video from Discord is more powerful than a perfectly produced one if it's real.
- **Track what works.** Which angles get engagement? Which drive community members? Double down on those.

---

## QUICK CONTENT CREATION WORKFLOW (To Make This Sustainable)

**Month 1 (Launch):** You personally create most content (video, main article, key posts).

**Month 2-3:** Delegate to team members. Each person owns an angle or two.
- Person A: UX/Product thought leadership (Angle 1, 7)
- Person B: Community/user stories (Angle 2, 4)
- Person C: Startup/business narrative (Angle 5, 8)

**Month 4+:** Invite collaborators/community members to create content.
- "Guest blog post" series from users/partners
- User testimonials
- Podcast appearances
- Reddit threads seeded by community

This scales without burning you out.
