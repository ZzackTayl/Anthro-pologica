## FINAL GUIDANCE

**Start with the version that feels most authentically *you*.** 

If you try to force Version 2 (professional) when you're naturally Version 1 (personal), it won't land. If you're naturally thoughtful but you try to do Version 4 (punchy), it'll feel off.

The best video is the one where you're genuinely yourself.

So:
1. Read all 5 out loud
2. Which felt most natural?
3. That's your starting point
4. Shoot it
5. Use the data to inform what's next

You've got this. Your story is compelling. Let your authenticity shine through, and the rest will follow.
