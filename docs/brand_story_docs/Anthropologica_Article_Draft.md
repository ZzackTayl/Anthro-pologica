# How Three Neurodivergent UX Designers Built a $0-Budget Venture Studio and Landed on the Real Future of Product Design

## Anthropologica's Journey from Research to Action: Where Neurodivergence, UX, and Intentional AI Create Products People Actually Want

---

## The Beginning: When You Can't Find the Work That Fits You

In May 2025, two neurodivergent designers couldn't find work that aligned with their values. The startup ecosystem was buzzing about AI, the job market was fractured, and everywhere they looked, companies were either cutting UX budgets or treating UX as a feature—something AI could now "solve." Meanwhile, I was still working as a UX Researcher at Applause, spending my nights and weekends experimenting with AI tools, watching the patterns emerge: most people using AI had no idea what they were doing, and the people watching those people use AI had no framework for making it meaningful.

So we did what many neurodivergent people do when the traditional path doesn't fit: we built our own path.

We founded **Anthropologica**, a UX venture studio built on a radical premise: that in a world where anyone can build an app, only those that *connect deeply with real users* will survive. That neurodivergence isn't a barrier to entrepreneurship—it's a competitive advantage. That AI is best used not as a replacement for human judgment, but as a tool for accelerating intentional, research-backed design decisions.

Six months later, we're soft-launching **MyOrbit**, a calendar and connection app designed for neurodivergent users, Gen Z, and people navigating complex relationship structures. We've tested it with hundreds of users, iterated based on actual research, and built something that feels genuinely different from every calendar app on the market.

But this isn't a tech triumph story. It's a story about how paying attention—really paying attention—to what users actually need changes everything. And how neurodivergent thinking is the secret weapon most companies are ignoring.

## The Aha Moment: The UX Crisis Everyone's Missing

My background is five years of UX research. I've delivered research findings to dozens of stakeholders at startups, agencies, and Fortune 50 companies. The pattern was consistent: teams that listened to their users built products that mattered. Teams that didn't... well, they burned money and shut down.

But something's shifted. With the rise of AI, I started noticing a worrying trend: leadership was declaring UX "dead." AI could generate interfaces. AI could moderate user interviews. AI could synthesize findings. Why pay for researchers and designers?

Here's the problem they didn't see: **AI cannot understand context. AI cannot know when to ask a follow-up question. AI cannot read the silence that means someone's uncomfortable. AI cannot understand that people behave differently when a machine is asking questions than when a human is.**

A company I'd been consulting with conducted AI-moderated user interviews. The "research" came back recommending they build exactly what they'd planned to build. No surprises. No contradictions. No human moments. It wasn't research—it was expensive confirmation bias.

This revealed something deeper: there's a massive knowledge gap about what UX actually *is*. People think it's "UI." They think it's "making things pretty." They don't understand it's **the methodology for understanding why people use (or don't use) products, and designing experiences around those truths.**

And in a world where anyone can build an app quickly, that methodology—that rigor, that human-centered approach—becomes more critical than ever, not less.

That's when I realized: **I have the secret recipe.**

UX research gives you the "what" and "why." Neurodivergent thinking gives you the permission to diverge, to explore strange solutions, to hyperfocus on problems that matter. And when you combine both with intentional AI use (not hype, not party tricks—actual strategic application), you get products that *feel magical* because they're solving real problems in ways people didn't expect.

## The Problem We're Solving: Calendar Apps Designed for a Life Nobody Lives

When we started researching, we asked a simple question: **What's broken about the way people coordinate time and stay connected?**

The answers came from Reddit, competitor reviews, user interviews, and countless conversations in Gen Z, LGBTQ+, neurodivergent, and polyamorous communities (which overlap significantly). Here's what we found:

### **Pain Point 1: Time Blindness and Notification Failure**

Neurodivergent users told us they constantly miss calendar notifications. Not because they're forgetful—but because notifications "disappear without being tapped or dismissed." They pop up, get buried, or blend into the chaos of their notification center. For people with time blindness, the calendar itself becomes invisible. Hours pass. Suddenly it's too late.

**Existing apps' solution:** More notifications. Push harder. More alerts. This creates notification fatigue—the opposite of what ND users need.

**Our approach:** A reliable, attention-grabbing notification system. Customizable timing and urgency levels. Notifications that stay visible until actively dismissed. And for users who struggle with time linearity, a circular 24-hour calendar view that makes time tangible and visible.

### **Pain Point 2: The Privacy Nightmare**

A Gen Z user told us they live with their dad—who doesn't support their queer identity. They also have a stepmom who's fully supportive. And a large friend group. They need to share their calendar to coordinate, but they can't let their dad see the full details of their plans.

Existing apps offer binary sharing: "Share calendar" or "Don't share." Google Calendar's sharing controls are powerful but famously confusing. Most apps don't even try.

**The reality:** People don't have one relationship type. They have family, partners, chosen family, work colleagues, casual friends. Each relationship has different needs for visibility. A parent doesn't need to know "I'm at Pride" or "I'm staying over at my boyfriend's." But they do need to know you're not available.

**Our approach:** Granular, event-level permission controls. You can share "Busy: date night with the girls" with your best friend who's crashing on your couch. Show your dad only that you're busy. Your boyfriend sees the full details. Same calendar. Different privacy for different people. This single feature—which no mainstream calendar app offers—solves a real problem for anyone navigating complex relationship structures.

### **Pain Point 3: Loneliness in the Scheduling Friction**

Multiple users told us the same thing: scheduling has become so friction-heavy that they've stopped trying. Coordinating with multiple friends, across multiple apps (text, calendar, poll tools), with conflicting schedules—by the time everyone agrees on a time, the social motivation has evaporated.

Polyamorous users faced an even sharper version: limited time with multiple partners, all of whom need coordination. The time spent scheduling was eating into the precious time actually together.

**Our approach:** Reduce friction at every step. Native language input ("Schedule dinner with Alex Tuesday"). A shared signals feature where you can quickly share what you're doing ("Making coffee at home, come vibe?") without formal invitations. Collaborative scheduling tools. And—here's the key—AI assistance that respects people's time and energy. AI that reschedules conflicts, proposes alternatives, or generates a brief message using your voice ("Still on for Thursday? Can't wait!") *only if you enable it*. Not replacing human decision-making, but removing the tedious parts.

### **Pain Point 4: "I Don't Know When I Last Hung Out With Them"**

People feel bad about drifting away from friends they care about. They don't actively choose it. Time just passes. Life gets busy. Suddenly it's been six months.

For polyamorous and neurodivergent users, this is compounded. Managing time across multiple relationships + time blindness = easy to inadvertently neglect someone you care about.

**Our approach:** A feature we call "orbit." Each person in your circle is represented as a planet in the night sky. As you schedule time together, the planet stays close and bright. As time passes without connection, the planet drifts further away. Visual reminders (completely optional, and covert—the other person doesn't get notified) nudge you if someone's been in orbit too long. It's gentle. It's visual. It's *designed for how neurodivergent brains work*.

## How We Built It: The UX Method Works When You Actually Use It

This is where Anthropologica's approach diverges from typical startup methodology. We didn't build a prototype and hope. We spent the first two months doing deep research, competitor analysis, and assumption mapping—the unglamorous, often-skipped part of product design.

### **Research That Shaped Every Decision**

We scraped hundreds of reviews from Timetree, Howbout, Google Calendar, Proton Calendar, and Weel Planner. We conducted screened user interviews with carefully selected participants (our core personas: neurodivergent Gen Z, LGBTQ+ users, and polyamorous folks). We ran surveys, analyzed pain points, and tagged themes.

For each feature we considered, we asked: **Does this solve a research-backed pain point? Have we validated this with users? How does it compare to what competitors are doing—and why are they not solving this?**

**Example decision:** The granular permission system. Our first assumption was "users want to share their whole calendar or not." Users corrected us immediately. They needed event-level control. This became a core differentiator.

**Example decision:** The orbit feature. We discovered in research that people felt guilty about friendship drift. We tested three different visual approaches (list of contacts with dates, a calendar-based view, and the orbit concept). The orbit won because it made time *tangible and emotional*, not just a number.

### **Our Competitive Positioning (And What Everyone Else Missed)**

| Calendar App | What They Do Well | Critical Gap | Why We're Different |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Google Calendar** | Ecosystem integration, ubiquitous, free | Confusing privacy controls; cognitively heavy interface; designed for work, not relationships | Privacy by design; built for neurodivergent brains; relationship-first, not work-first |
| **Howbout** | Gen Z-focused; great for casual friend coordination | Overwhelm­ing notifications create anxiety; mobile-only; doesn't address complex sharing needs | Customizable notifications; respects relationship nuance; works across devices |
| **Proton Calendar** | Privacy-focused; encrypted | Limited features; not designed for social coordination or neurodivergence | Privacy + social features; accessibility-first design |
| **Weel Planner** | ADHD-friendly circular view; explicitly queer-friendly | Passive tool; weak AI; lacks sophisticated data models for complex scheduling | Active AI assistance; better data architecture; community co-design |
| **Reclaim.ai / Clockwise** | AI automation; focus time blocking | Expensive; work-only focus; ignores relationships and personal life | Affordable; relationship-focused; personalization for different life contexts |

The pattern: most apps optimize for *either* productivity *or* privacy *or* accessibility. Nobody's optimizing for all three. Nobody's building *with* the communities most affected.

### **The Neurodivergent Advantage: Diverge, Then Converge**

Here's where our neurodivergence genuinely became a superpower.

In the early stages, we'd diverge: explore weird ideas, investigate rabbit holes, spend hours testing edge cases and creative possibilities. One teammate would hyperfocus on a specific user flow and uncover edge cases nobody else saw. Another would pattern-match across research data and spot connections we'd missed. A third would bring a detailed, methodical eye that caught inconsistencies.

Without structure, this would be chaos. But we built structure *around* the divergence. We created a prioritization matrix for ideas: Does it solve a research-backed pain point? Can we validate it with users? Does it differentiate us? How much development effort? We'd diverge on weekends and async, then converge in weekly meetings to synthesize, prioritize, and challenge assumptions.

**Example:** One of us spent an entire weekend exploring how AI could predict scheduling conflicts before they happen. It was a tangent. But during that tangent, they discovered a data architecture pattern we're now using to make the app significantly faster. The "waste" of time became foundational infrastructure.

**Another example:** Someone hyperfocused on notification design after noticing that research participants were missing alerts. They tested 47 different notification approaches (yes, 47). Out of that obsessive exploration, we found three approaches that worked—and implemented a system where users could pick their own.

This diverge-and-converge cycle is *intentional* neurodivergence. We're not trying to "fix" our brains to work like neurotypical teams. We're structuring our process *to amplify* how our brains actually work.

### **AI: Intentional vs. Hype**

We use AI strategically. Not everywhere. Not as a replacement for human judgment.

Here's what we use it for:
- **Synthesis:** Taking raw user research notes and helping identify key themes (which we then validate ourselves)
- **Ideation:** Showing us variations on design concepts we've already sketched
- **Support:** Helping with copywriting, summarizing feedback, organizing insights into our NotebookLM folders
- **Accessibility:** Natural language input for event creation; optional AI-generated message suggestions using user voice

Here's what we *don't* use it for:
- Making research decisions (humans do that)
- Replacing user testing (we A/B test everything)
- Automating away the thinking (we debate, validate, iterate)

We A/B tested different approaches to AI in the app itself. Users were fine with AI-generated animations and icons (they expect computers make those). They didn't want AI-generated videos with fake humans—that killed trust immediately. They appreciated AI-assisted scheduling *only if* it asked for permission and showed them options.

This is where most AI implementations fail: they optimize for "wow" factor instead of user trust. We optimize for trust, and it turns out that's more magical.

## The Team: Neurodivergence as Culture

The three of us came together because we understood something most founding teams don't: **working with people who share your neurodivergence means you get each other without constant explanation.** We share the same values. We communicate differently than neurotypical teams. We work better with structure and flexibility than with rigid hierarchy.

One of us brings the big-picture vision and connects dots across research, strategy, and market opportunities. Another brings relentless attention to detail—they catch inconsistencies in user feedback that everyone else misses. A third (me) brings the research and design methodology, plus the storytelling to hold it all together.

We don't fit the "co-founder power trio" narrative. We're not best friends who met in college. We found each other because the existing work world didn't work for us. And that shared experience of being "outside" the default way of doing things? That's actually a huge advantage.

We also built space for our neurodivergence to show up:
- We don't have traditional 9-5 hours. We have core sync times and a lot of async work
- We use documentation heavily (written communication is more reliable for us than verbal-only)
- We celebrate hyperfocus instead of pathologizing it
- We have weekly check-ins where we explicitly talk about what's working and what's not
- We take breaks when we need them. We don't glorify burnout

This isn't soft, feel-good stuff. It's operational efficiency. We ship faster because we're not fighting our own brains.

## What's Different About Anthropologica

Most venture-backed startups follow the same playbook: raise money, move fast, break things, scale first, ask questions later. That approach assumes every user is the same and that speed matters more than depth.

We're deliberately different.

**We bootstrap intentionally.** We're not opposed to funding if the right aligned investors exist, but we're also not chasing it. Lower burn rate means we can take time to get the product right. We can say no to features that don't align with our values. We can turn down users who don't respect our community.

**We build with our community, not for it.** We host biweekly design jams on Discord where anyone can watch us work, leave feedback in real time, and literally shape the product. Users aren't an afterthought. They're partners.

**We have hard values.** We will never IPO. We won't harvest data unless we're paying users for it (and even then, only if it aligns with our mission). We pay living wages. We only hire people who align with our values. We only take on clients/partners who promise to run their company on our principles.

**We believe neurodivergence and queerness are brand features, not bugs.** We're not "inclusive by accident." We're building *for* these communities because we're in them. We understand the problems because we live them. This isn't performative allyship. It's authentic.

**We use UX as our strategic advantage.** When most competitors are competing on features or price, we're competing on *meaning*. Do our users feel seen? Do they feel like we get them? Do they trust us with their data? That trust is unbeatable.

## MyOrbit: A Case Study in Applying This Philosophy

MyOrbit launches in 10 days into beta. Here's what ships:

**Core features:**
- Multiple calendar views (linear, circular for ADHD brains, day/week/month)
- Granular event-level permission controls (show "busy," show event title, show full details—customizable per person)
- Orbit feature (visual representation of relationships, nudges if you haven't connected recently)
- Signals (covert way to broadcast availability: "Making coffee, anyone want to join?")
- Notification customization (intensity, timing, delivery method—in-app, push, both)
- Natural language input for events
- Optional AI assistance for rescheduling (with human approval required)

**What we're not shipping (yet):**
- Complex calendar integrations (we're validating UX first)
- Group management at scale (niche use case—we're starting with intimate circles)
- Advanced AI features that haven't been user-tested

**What we're doing in beta:**
- Daily iteration based on community feedback
- Biweekly design jams where users influence the roadmap
- Rigorous privacy and security testing (this isn't an afterthought)
- A/B testing on messaging, notification design, and AI assistance
- Ongoing user research to inform post-beta releases

Our success metric isn't DAU or viral coefficient. It's: *Do users feel like we built something that actually respects them and solves their real problem?* Retention. Organic growth through word-of-mouth. Users who bring their friends because they genuinely love the product.

## The Challenges We're Honest About

Building this way isn't frictionless.

**We're working for free.** All three of us. Our runway is finite. If we don't hit product-market fit or find aligned funding within a certain timeline, this ends. That's real pressure.

**Marketing is hard when you refuse to be manipulative.** We won't use dark patterns or misleading CTAs. We won't fake scarcity or urgency. We're competing against companies that will do all of those things. Our bet is that authenticity + word-of-mouth + community can win. We believe it. But it's slower.

**Privacy and security slow us down.** Most apps ship and deal with security later. We encrypted the app from day one. That's extra development cost and complexity. But when you're asking people to share calendar data that reveals intimate details about their lives, cutting corners isn't an option.

**We're not venture-scale.** We're OK with that. But it means we need to be very thoughtful about projects we take on, partnerships we pursue, and growth channels we prioritize. We can't do everything.

**Some of our team dynamics take work.** We have very different working styles. Async communication is powerful but also slower than real-time collaboration. We sometimes get stuck in analysis paralysis because we're all detail-oriented. We've had to build practices around divergence so it doesn't become endless rabbit-holes.

We're also honest that **we need help.** Specifically:
- **Marketing strategy & community partnerships:** We're designers and researchers, not growth marketers. We need people who understand organic growth, community building, and authentic partnership.
- **Flutter development:** We have the design and architecture. We need experienced Flutter developers to help scale the backend safely.
- **Content creation:** We have ideas. We don't have the bandwidth. If you're passionate about creating content for neurodivergent/LGBTQ+/Gen Z audiences, we'd love your help.

If you're reading this and thinking, *"I want to build something meaningful with people who actually care about the work"*—that's who we're looking for. Not resume-based hiring. Culture-fit hiring. Values-aligned hiring. People with a bias for action who want to build with us early.

## Why This Matters: The Future of Product Design Is Human-Centered (Again)

Here's the real insight: we're at an inflection point.

For the past decade, companies have optimized for scale, engagement, and monetization—often at the expense of user trust and wellbeing. AI is accelerating this tension. Companies can now build products *faster* without thinking about whether they should. They can automate away human judgment in pursuit of efficiency.

But users can feel it. They know when a product is designed for them vs. designed to extract from them. They know when AI is being used creatively vs. as window dressing. They know when a company actually cares about their privacy.

The companies that will win aren't the ones that move fastest or raise the most money. They're the ones that build products people genuinely want to use. Products that save them time, energy, or worry. Products that respect them.

That requires UX. That requires research. That requires talking to real people and taking their feedback seriously. That requires design principles rooted in something deeper than hype.

And it turns out, neurodivergent teams are uniquely positioned to do this well. We're used to feeling like outsiders. We notice what doesn't work. We have unusual problem-solving approaches. We're motivated by mission more than money. We build the products we desperately need because the market hasn't served us.

If your company is still treating UX as an afterthought, treating research as a nice-to-have, treating neurodivergent employees as "high-maintenance" rather than high-value—your products probably aren't as good as you think. And users can tell.

The good news: there's a better way. It's slower. It's more intentional. It requires listening. But it works.

## What's Next

MyOrbit launches in 10 days. SpoonSaver—an app helping neurodivergent users navigate mental energy and share that data with therapists/coaches—is in the pipeline, waiting for prioritization.

But more broadly, Anthropologica is building something bigger than any single product: a model for how neurodivergent teams can build companies that matter. A proof point that you don't need venture funding to build something meaningful. That you don't need to compromise your values to succeed. That the future of product design is human-centered, relationship-first, and rooted in actual user needs.

We're inviting people into this experiment. If you're a designer tired of the startup hype cycle. If you're a developer who wants your work to matter. If you're a marketer or community builder who wants to reach people authentically. If you're someone who's felt outside the default path and want to build something different—**come build with us.**

Join our Discord. Watch us work. Give us feedback. Tell us what's broken. Tell us what matters to you. Be part of the change.

The future of product design isn't written by the biggest companies with the biggest budgets. It's written by small teams that care deeply, think carefully, and build with intention.

We're one of those teams. And we're just getting started.
