# MyOrbit Case Study: Executive Summary & One-Pager
## For Busy Stakeholders (Investors, Press, Partners)

---

## The Headline

**Three neurodivergent UX professionals built a $150K calendar app for $800 in 6 months.**

Even with today's AI tools, competitors spend $95K-$130K for similar scope and quality. The difference isn't AI. It's **UX methodology.**

---

## The Problem (Real, Not Assumed)

Most calendars are designed for a world that doesn't exist: 9-to-5 work, traditional families, monogamous relationships. 

In 2025, people need calendars that:
- Support complex relationships (polyamorous, queer, chosen family)
- Accommodate neurodivergent brains (time blindness, notification fatigue)
- Respect privacy (different people see different information)
- Fight loneliness (help people prioritize connection over optimization)

We didn't guess this. We researched it:
- 300+ competitor reviews analyzed
- 40+ user interviews (screened personas: neurodivergent Gen Z, LGBTQ+, polyamorous)
- 100+ Reddit threads analyzed
- Assumption maps created and validated

---

## The Solution: MyOrbit

A calendar redesigned for *relationships*, not just scheduling.

**Core Features:**
1. **Granular Permission Controls** — Show "busy" to one person, full details to another, nothing to a third
2. **Orbit Feature** — Visual representation of relationship proximity; nudges if connections drift
3. **Signals** — Covert availability broadcast ("making coffee, join me?")
4. **Smart Notifications** — Customizable, attention-grabbing, accessible
5. **Natural Language Input** — "Schedule dinner with Alex Tuesday"
6. **Community Co-Design** — Users literally building the product with you

## How We Built It: The Methodology (Replicable)

### **Phase 1: Research First (Weeks 1-8)**
- Competitive analysis mapped against user pain points
- Synthesized findings into 12 NotebookLM folders
- Created prioritization matrix: Does it solve real problems? Differentiates? How much effort?
- Ruthlessly cut 60+ feature ideas; focused on core 5-6

**Cost: $0**

### **Phase 2: Prototype & Test (Weeks 9-20)**
- 5 rounds of user testing with 100+ total participants
- Each round informed the next (not build-and-hope)
- Validated every assumption with data

**Cost: $0**

### **Phase 3: AI-Assisted Development (Weeks 21-26)**
- **AI for:** Iconography, brand development, animations, code review, secondary research synthesis, bug testing
- **Humans for:** Research, strategy, decisions, validation, copy, values alignment
- **Result:** Moved fast without losing rigor

**Cost: $800** (Upwork consultation for specific Flutter expertise, AI tools)

## The Cost Breakdown: Why 98% Less Than Industry Standard?

| Development Approach | Cost | Timeline | Quality |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Traditional (2-3 years ago)** | $150K+ | 12+ months | High |
| **With AI tools (current avg)** | $95-130K | 8-10 months | High (30-40% cost reduction from AI) |
| **Our approach** | $800 | 6 months | High |

**Why the gap?**
1. UX methodology eliminated rework (knew what to build before building)
2. Intentional AI use eliminated low-value tasks
3. Neurodivergent team structure enabled fast, focused problem-solving
4. User validation at every step caught issues early
5. Ruthless prioritization (said "no" to 60+ features)

---

## What We Proved

### **Product**
- Launched with zero critical bugs
- 95% of beta testers would recommend (net promoter score range)
- 3 features competitors don't have
- Designed specifically for neurodivergent brains

### **Market**
- Differentiated from Google Calendar, Howbout, Proton, Weel
- Addresses $10B+ addressable market (neurodivergent + LGBTQ+ + polyamorous + lonely Gen Z)
- Timing: Loneliness is public health crisis; privacy is becoming table-stakes

### **Team**
- 3 neurodivergent people > most teams of 12
- Diverge/converge methodology = innovation without chaos
- Sustainable pace (no burnout, all working for free currently but with clear path to living wage)

### **Community**
- Discord community actively co-designing product
- Users feel invested and heard
- This loyalty is hard for competitors to replicate

## Why Our Moat Isn't Features

Stakeholders ask: "Google could build this in two weeks."

**True. But they can't replicate:**

1. **Community loyalty** — Our users are building the product *with* us, not just buying it
2. **Research rigor** — Every feature traces back to user data (most competitors don't have this)
3. **Values alignment** — Never IPO, no data harvesting, LGBTQ+ and neurodivergence support (not marketing; operational)
4. **Lived experience** — Built *for* this community, not retrofitted for accessibility
5. **Relationship-first DNA** — While Google Calendar is tools-first, we're relationship-first

Google can clone our features in weeks. They can't clone our culture, community, or methodology.

---

## The Bigger Picture: Why This Matters

This isn't just "cheaper app development." It's proof that:

- **UX methodology is an unfair advantage** (even against AI hype)
- **Neurodivergent teams are a superpower** (when structured right)
- **You don't need VC capital to build great things** (you need focus and rigor)
- **AI amplifies human creativity; it doesn't replace it** (when used intentionally)
- **Privacy and values are defensible strategy** (not just marketing)
- **Loneliness is a $10B+ problem** (most products aren't solving it; we are)

---

## What We're Looking For

**Immediate needs:**
1. **Talent** — Engineering, marketing, operations; people with bias for action + mission alignment
2. **Investment** — Values-aligned only (privacy-first, LGBTQ+/neurodivergence-focused, no pressure for unicorn valuations)
3. **Partnerships** — Product, distribution, media, speaking opportunities
4. **Consulting** — Teaching other companies how to do UX + AI right

---

## Key Metrics

| Metric | Result |
|---|---|
| **Cost to build** | $800 (vs. $150K industry standard) |
| **Timeline** | 6 months (idea to production) |
| **Team size** | 3 people |
| **User testing rounds** | 5 (100+ total participants) |
| **Beta NPS** | 95% would recommend |
| **Core differentiators** | 3+ features competitors don't have |
| **Market opportunity** | $10B+ (neurodivergent + LGBTQ+ + polyamorous + lonely Gen Z) |
| **Time to replicate (for competitors)** | 6+ months (despite their larger budgets, because of UX rigor) |

---

## The Open-Sourced Methodology

We're teaching others how to do this:

1. **Research Process** — Competitor analysis, user interviews, assumption mapping
2. **Prioritization Matrix** — How to say "no" to 60+ features
3. **AI Workflow** — What AI does, what humans do, how to validate everything
4. **Diverge/Converge Framework** — How neurodivergent teams solve problems faster
5. **Design Principles for Neurodivergence** — Making accessibility the default
6. **Community Co-Design Process** — Turning users into advocates

Companies are paying 6-figures for consulting on this. We're documenting it.

---

## Bottom Line

We spent **$800** and **6 months** to build something competitors can't replicate with 100x the budget, because **we prioritized UX, community, and rigor over hype.**

That's not luck. That's strategy.

And it's the future of product development.

## Next Steps

- **Soft launch:** End of November (beta, gathering feedback)
- **Talent recruitment:** Ongoing (dev, marketing, operations)
- **Consulting launch:** Q1 2026 (teaching other companies this methodology)
- **Seed funding:** If right investors appear who share our values
