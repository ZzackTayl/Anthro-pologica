### SCRIPT

Hi, I'm Zack. I'm neurodivergent, a UX researcher, and I'm one of the founders of **MyOrbit**—a calendar app launching soon that's designed to help us all spend more time with the people we care about and less time on our phones and planning.

Here's why we built it: I've struggled my entire life to maintain friendships. I forget to reach out. Sometimes at the worst times. As I've gotten older, especially with a group of friends and being intentional when you're busy... it just gets harder.

That's not a personal failure. That's a *design* failure. Our calendars don't help us *stay connected*. They just add more friction.

So MyOrbit does something different. You can set goals for how much time you'd ideally like to spend with people you care about. Get gentle nudges—visual reminders in your orbit—if it's been a while. And you can share your availability without exposing all the details of your personal life to people you don't fully trust.

Because your calendar is deeply personal. Your calendar reflects your relationships, your values, your life. You deserve control over who sees what.

That's what we're building. Join us on Discord. Help shape this with us.

---

### WHY THIS WORKS
- Opens with identity (neurodivergent, researcher, founder)
- Immediately names the problem *you personally faced* (missed connections, friendship maintenance)
- Reframes it: "not a personal failure, it's a design failure" (powerful)
- Shows specific features (goals, nudges, privacy controls) organically
- Ends with authentic ask (help shape it with us, not "buy this")
- Total time: ~65 seconds

### VISUALS TO PAIR
- You on camera, speaking naturally
- Screenshots of the orbit feature (planets getting closer/farther)
- Calendar interface showing privacy controls
- Discord community screenshot
- Brief clips of design jam or team working

---

## VERSION 2: "The Professional Observation" (Credibility + Market Insight)
**Best for:** LinkedIn, UX/Product professionals, thought leadership
**Length:** 75-90 seconds
**Tone:** Observational, expert, grounded in data
**Strength:** Establishes credibility; appeals to professionals; shows research backing

---

### SCRIPT

I'm Zack, a UX researcher with five years of experience working with startups and Fortune 50 companies. And I've noticed a pattern.

The companies that listen to their users build products that matter. The companies that don't... well, they burn money and shut down.

But something's shifted. Today, many teams would rather talk to synthetic users—ChatGPT—than actually meet people where they are. They're rushing to market without understanding their actual users.

So I and two other neurodivergent designers decided to do something different. We spent six months researching before building anything. Talking to hundreds of people. Understanding pain points. Challenging our assumptions.

What we found: Most calendar apps are designed for a life nobody lives. They assume everyone works 9-to-5, has one family, one calendar, one way of relating to time.

**The reality?** Gen Z has complex relationships. Neurodivergent folks struggle with time blindness. Polyamorous people are managing time across multiple partners. Privacy is a real concern—especially for queer and vulnerable users.

So we built **MyOrbit** for that reality. Customizable privacy. Gentle nudges for friendship maintenance. Designed for actual human relationships, not assumptions.

We're launching soon. If you're interested in how intentional UX and neurodivergent thinking can build better products, let's talk.

---

### WHY THIS WORKS
- Establishes credibility fast (5 years, worked with Fortune 50)
- Shows pattern recognition (companies that listen vs. don't)
- Names what's wrong (synthetic users, rushing, assumptions)
- Shows research methodology (6 months, hundreds of people)
- Lists specific personas affected (Gen Z, ND, poly, queer)
- Ties features to research (privacy, nudges)
- Professional but not corporate
- Total time: ~80 seconds

### VISUALS TO PAIR
- You on camera (or quick team montage)
- Competitor screenshots showing "life nobody lives" aesthetic
- Your research/notes (quick glimpses)
- MyOrbit interface showing features
- Maybe a quick statistic on screen (e.g., "% of users who struggle with friendship maintenance")

## VERSION 3: "The Team Strength" (Neurodivergence + Collaboration)
**Best for:** Recruitment, team building, YouTube/TikTok
**Length:** 75-90 seconds
**Tone:** Energetic, proud, authentic
**Strength:** Appeals to neurodivergent folks + people looking for culture; shows what you're building beyond the product

---

### SCRIPT

We're three neurodivergent designers. Two of us couldn't find work that aligned with our values. One of us (me) was experimenting with AI in my off-hours. So we said, "Why wait for the perfect job? Let's build it."

We're building **MyOrbit**, a calendar app launching soon. But more than that, we're building **Anthropologica**—a venture studio for people who want to create products and companies we'd actually want to use and work at.

Here's what's wild: Being neurodivergent isn't a liability. It's our superpower.

We diverge—we explore, we investigate, we hyperfocus on problems, we go down creative rabbit holes. Then we converge—we prioritize, synthesize, challenge our assumptions, and focus on what actually matters.

That's how we built something different. We didn't just theorize about what users need. We actually talked to them. We iterated. We tested. We listened.

And we're hiring. If you're someone who's tired of the startup hype cycle, who wants to build something meaningful with people who actually care about the work, who want a team that values your neurodivergence instead of trying to fix it—we're looking for you.

Come build with us.

---

### WHY THIS WORKS
- Opens with identity + origin story (relatable to neurodivergent audience)
- Names what you're building (product + venture studio)
- Reframes neurodivergence as strength, not limitation
- Shows methodology (diverge/converge) concretely
- Makes explicit ask for team members
- Tone is energetic and genuine
- Total time: ~85 seconds

### VISUALS TO PAIR
- Quick clips of all three founders (if willing to be on camera)
- Design jam footage from Discord (users engaging with product)
- Team working together (async, in person, whatever you have)
- Screenshots of MyOrbit
- "We're hiring" graphic
- Discord invite link

---

## VERSION 4: "The Problem Statement (Specific)" (Feature-Focused + User-Centric)
**Best for:** TikTok, Reels, YouTube Shorts
**Length:** 45-60 seconds (shorter = more shareable)
**Tone:** Direct, slightly humorous, empathetic
**Strength:** Shows exactly what the product does; easy to understand; highly shareable

---

### SCRIPT

If you're neurodivergent, queer, or in a non-traditional relationship, your calendar is a nightmare.

Your dad needs to think you're just "busy." Your boyfriend gets full details. Your best friend who's crashing with you should know you're out. Your work colleague? Doesn't need to know anything.

Existing calendar apps: "Share your calendar or don't."

That's it. That's your choice.

We're building something different. **MyOrbit** lets you set different privacy levels *per person, per event*. Show busy to one person. Show the event title to another. Full details to your inner circle.

Oh, and if you're like me and constantly forget to reach out to friends? We built in gentle nudges. Visual reminders of your orbit—the people you care about. So you don't accidentally let them drift away.

It's launching soon. Join our Discord for early access.

---

### WHY THIS WORKS
- Immediately speaks to specific audiences (neurodivergent, queer, non-traditional)
- Makes the problem crystal clear with concrete example
- Contrasts what exists (binary sharing) with solution (granular control)
- Adds relatable second problem (friend drift)
- Calls to action is simple (Discord link)
- Can be delivered in 45 seconds or expanded to 60
- Very shareable format
- Total time: ~55 seconds

### VISUALS TO PAIR
- Start: You on camera
- Quick split-screen showing the problem (app calendar looks generic and boring)
- Then show the solution (MyOrbit interface with granular privacy controls)
- Show the orbit feature (planets, visual nudges)
- End with Discord link graphic

---

## VERSION 5: "The Values Play" (Why This Matters + Movement-Building)
**Best for:** YouTube, LinkedIn, Medium (if you want audio), brand positioning
**Length:** 90 seconds
**Tone:** Thoughtful, mission-driven, subtle rage
**Strength:** Builds movement; appeals to values-aligned collaborators; positions you as leaders

---

### SCRIPT

I've been a UX researcher for five years. I've watched companies build products.

The ones that succeed? They listen to their users. They understand their struggles. They design experiences that actually respect people.

The ones that fail? They chase hype. They ignore research. They treat users as data to harvest, not people to serve.

What I've learned: in a world where anyone can build an app, only the products that *connect deeply* with real users survive.

That's why we started **Anthropologica**. We're three neurodivergent designers who are tired of the status quo. Tired of apps that don't respect your privacy. Tired of calendars that don't understand your relationships. Tired of companies that prioritize growth over *actually helping people*.

**MyOrbit** is our proof point. A calendar designed for real human relationships. For neurodivergent brains. For queer folks managing complex sharing needs. For people who want privacy, not surveillance.

We're not chasing unicorn status. We're not planning an IPO. We're building a company we'd want to work at. With people we trust. For people we care about.

If you believe design can be different—if you believe technology can be better—come build with us.

---

### WHY THIS WORKS
- Opens with authority (5 years of research + pattern recognition)
- States the clear pattern (listen = win, ignore = fail)
- Names what's wrong with status quo (hype, harvest, disrespect)
- Positions Anthropologica as response to that
- Frames MyOrbit as proof of concept
- Explicit about values (no unicorn chase, no IPO, trustworthy)
- Calls to values-aligned people
- Builds movement, not just selling a product
- Total time: ~90 seconds

### VISUALS TO PAIR
- You on camera, speaking directly
- Maybe quick montage of frustrating calendar app experiences
- Then contrast with MyOrbit's thoughtful design
- Images that convey values (diverse people, genuine moments)
- Ending shot of team or community
- "Join us" call-to-action

## HOW TO USE THESE SCRIPTS

### **Option A: Pick Your Favorite**
Choose the one that feels most authentically *you*. Memorize the key points but speak naturally. Don't script-read; let it be conversational.

### **Option B: Create a Series**
Use different versions across different platforms:
- Version 1 on Instagram (personal, vulnerable)
- Version 2 on LinkedIn (thought leadership)
- Version 3 on Discord/YouTube (team/recruitment)
- Version 4 on TikTok/Reels (shareable, punchy)
- Version 5 as your long-form "manifesto" video

### **Option C: Hybrid Approach**
Take the opening from Version 1, the middle from Version 5, the close from Version 3. Make it your own.

### **Option D: Update Over Time**
Use Version 1 now. In a few months after launch, test Version 2. Track which gets more engagement/comments/shares. Double down on what works.

## A/B TESTING SUGGESTION

Since you're data-driven:
1. **Pick two versions** (e.g., 1 and 4)
2. **Post them on different platforms** (Version 1 on Instagram, Version 4 on TikTok)
3. **Track:** Views, engagement, comments, DMs, Discord joins
4. **After 2 weeks:** See which one resonated more
5. **Double down on that version**, then test another variation

## YOUR VOICE VS. THESE SCRIPTS

These scripts are written in a *tone* that matches what you've told me, but they're not your exact words. When you film, please:
- Adjust vocabulary to match how you naturally speak
- Change phrasing if it doesn't feel authentic
- Add your own personal details/examples
- Let your personality come through
- Pause, breathe, be real

The script is a *skeleton*. Your delivery is the *soul*.

Authenticity will always outperform "perfect" scripting.

---

## NEXT STEPS

1. **Read all 5 versions out loud.** Which one felt most natural?
2. **Record yourself** reading your favorite version (even if rough).
3. **Share with co-founders.** Do they have a preference?
4. **Pick platform.** Where do you want to post first?
5. **Shoot.** Keep it simple. You + phone camera + natural lighting.
6. **Post.** See what happens. Track engagement.
7. **Iterate.** After data, adjust if needed.

You've got the story. You've got the research. You've got the credentials. The video just needs to let your authenticity shine through.

Go make it.
